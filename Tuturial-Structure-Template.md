## Intro ##
> (do not include section title) 

Write a paragraph that introduces the topic. Explain why the content is relevant, and make sure to introduce the concepts you plan to cover.
 
## Prerequisites ##
> (use as section title)

List what the reader needs to know, as well as packages or SDKS that must be available, to successfully work through the tutorial. Keep the list short, but be sure to include language and concepts the reader should be familiar with.  

**IMPORTANT**: The last prerequisite will always be a link to the _“How to get started with Agora”_ tutorial using the url:
```
https://www.agora.io/en/blog/how-to-get-started-with-agora?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=
```

Append your tutorial’s title to the end of the link above, with an underscore replacing any spaces in the title, as in this example:

- **Blog Title:** How to Build a Token Server for Agora Applications using GoLang
- **URL**: https://www.agora.io/en/blog/how-to-get-started-with-agora?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=How_to_Build_a_Token_Server_for_Agora_Applications_using_GoLang

It's imperative that you type this URL correctly as it will be the primary way Agora can properly track developer conversion from individual content posts. 

## Project Setup ##
> (use as section title)
Describe the steps for creating a new project and setting up the environment. 

If there are any commands that need to be run in the command line make sure to include them using the “embedded code” feature ```  

## Build XYZ ##
> (use as section title replace XYZ with project feature being built in this section)  

Write the individual steps to building the specific feature within the project. 

There will be multiple Build XYZ sections within a single tutorial. The goal is to modularize the various elements and build the project in a logical way that makes it easy for the user to follow along.

### Build Subsection ### 
> (replace with title of subsection being built in this section)  

The Build XYZ section should be broken down into subsections that build the project in smaller chunks. This section could explain how to implement a set of functions that operate together to produce a specific feature of the project. Be sure to explain all inputs and outputs, discuss their significance within the code and how they work together.  

Within the Build and Build Subsections there should be code snippets included. All snippets should use GitHub Gists (on Agora Blog and Medium) and ``` within Dev.to or .md files.  

When embedding code using ``` be sure to include the language name.  

For example, use ```javascript to ensure it’s rendered with the proper code highlighting.  

When embedding code using GitHub Gists, if the code is only a snippet make sure to denote that in the file name following the format: `functionName+snippet.fileExtension`  

For example if my function name is generateToken and its a javascript snippet, the Gist would have the title: `generateToken+snippet.js`  

If the code within the Gist is an entire file or set of functions that can be copied and pasted and will work on their own as a library or project, you can just name the Gist after the file they would represent with the repository.  

## Testing XYZ ## 
> (use as section title; replace XYZ with the project or feature being tested)

Write the steps to test the project.  

## Conclusion ##
Write a short paragraph in conclusion. At the end of the paragraph, please include a link to the completed source code on GitHub.  

## Other Resources ## 
> (use as section title)

Always include a section at the end of each post that includes links to the relevant Agora Documentation and Advanced Guides.  

Also include a link to the Agora Developer Slack using this text:
> I also invite you to join the Agora.io Developer Slack community.
