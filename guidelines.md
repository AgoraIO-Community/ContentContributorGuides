# Writing Guidelines

The following are specific guidelines for guides written by the Agora team. This document is setup as a checklist to ensure the guide fits the format and style of the Agora Developer Guides.

For suggestions on the format and style, please refer to the [Agora-Tutorial-Structure-Template.md](./Agora-Tutorial-Structure-Template.md).

## Packaging

The title and thumbnail are the most important parts of a guide. If nobody clicks into the guide, your work will never be seen.

1. [ ] Title and thumbnail need to draw the reader in.

## Introduction

Once the reader clicks into the guide, the introduction is the next thing they see. Use this to hook them in.

2. [ ] Deliver on the title and thumbnail. Give the reader a reason to keep reading.

## Prerequisites

Treat each guide as if it were the reader's first time reading anything about Agora. However, you don't need to cover everything within the guide. That's what the prerequisites section is for.

3. [ ] Include everything the reader needs to have before starting this guide. (most guides should have at least the SDK you are working with and an Agora Developer account)

## Content

These are the guidelines that your writing needs to follow:

4. [ ] Technical writing should be clear and precise.
5. [ ] Concise. Only explain one idea per guide. Don't need to explain all the basics that are covered in the quickstart.
6. [ ] It should also be simple. The goal of these guides is not to show off your vocabulary but to present information to the reader in the most digestible and easy-to-understand for beginner developers.
7. [ ] Use active rather than passive voice to sound more confident and direct.
8. [ ] While writing, constantly ask yourself, "Why?" and answer it in your writing.
9. [ ] Use imagery to aid the content. (images, diagrams, screenshots)

## Ending

The goal of each guide is to bring people into the Agora ecosystem.

10. [ ] At the end of the guide, go full circle and loop back to the introduction.
11. [ ] CTA at the end should include 1-2 links that lead the reader into the Agora ecosystem. The link(s) should be chosen based on the reader's likelihood of clicking.

## Format and Submission

12. [ ] Write your content in markdown following these writing guidelines.
13. [ ] All projects must be uploaded to the AgoraIO-Community GitHub.
14. [ ] Guides must be run through the free Grammarly account to correct grammar mistakes.
15. [ ] Each guide must be pushed to the `docs` or `guide` branch, and authors need to open a PR and assign an Agora Developer Evangelist team member as a reviewer. This should include the guide and images in markdown so the reviewer can leave comments directly in the document.
16. [ ] Once a review is done, authors must update or respond to each comment until the original reviewer resolves all comments.
17. [ ] After PR approval, merge into main.

## Publishing

18. [ ] The author should then upload the blog to Medium (and Dev.to if desired).
19. [ ] Share all links with the DE team.
20. [ ] Once guide is published on Agora Blog, update the Medium post's cononical link using the Agora Blog URL.
