# Writing Guidelines
The following are specific guidelines for guides written by the Agora team.

## Packaging
The title and thumbnail are the most important parts of an guide. If nobody clicks into the guide your work will never be seen.
1. Titles & thumbnail need to draw the reader in.

## Introduction
Once the reader clicks into the guide, the introdution is the very next thing they see. Use this to hook them in.
2. Deliver on the Title & Thumbnail. Give the reader a reason to keep reading.

## Prerequisites
Treat each guide as if it's a readers first time reading anything about Agora. However, you don't need to cover everything within the guide. That's what the prerequisites section is for.
3. Include everything the reader needs to have before starting this guide. (most guides should have at least the SDK you are working with and an Agora Developer account)

## Content
These are the guidelines that your writing needs to follow.
4. Technical writing should be clear and precise. 
5. It should also be simple. The goal of these guides is not to show off your vocabulary, but to present information to the reader in the most digestable and easy to understand for beginner developers. 
6. Use active voice instead of passive voice to sound more confident and direct.
7. While you are writing, constantly as yourself "why?" and answer it in your writing.
8. Use imagery to aid the content. (images, diagrams, screenshots)

## Ending
The goal with each guide is to bring people into the Agora ecosystem.

9. At the end of the guide, go full circle and loop back to the introduction.
10. CTA at the end should include 1-2 links that lead the reader into the Agora ecosystem. The link(s) should be chosen based on the likelihood that the reader is going to click. 


## Publishing
11. Guides must be run through the free grammarly account to correct for grammar mistakes.
