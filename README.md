# Agora Community - Content Contributor Guides #
This repository will contain all documents related to the process for publishing content for the Agora Content Contributor Program. Please read the sections below and follow the instructions before submitting content for review/publication.

The Agora Content Contributor Program allows developers to create content for the Agora community. The work of community contributors expands and strengthens Agora’s Real-Time Engagement Platform tutorials. 

> For more information see the [Agora Content Contributor]() page.

## Writing Process ##
After you’ve submitted your application, a member of the Agora Dev Evangelist team will work with you to refine your outline and the feature set of your tutorial.

When writing content for the Agora Content Contributor Program, tutorials must follow the writing [template structure](/Tuturial-Structure-Template.md) ([Google Doc version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dgXSGk5QCZQbe7J-lUXInkcdeEBM1RDZNXNS1SGoC6I/edit?usp=sharing)) and [writing style guidelines](/content-contributor-program-writing-guidelines.pdf). 

Once the tutorial is written, authors must include a headline and the `meta` data tags (`author`, `description`, and `keywords`) for their submissions.

```html
  <meta name="description" content="Agora Web tutorial ...">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScrip, Live Broadcasting, Video">
  <meta name="author" content="Jane Doe">
```
> For more information on meta tags see [W3School's Meta Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp)

Once the tutorial is complete and ready for review, the Agora team will work with you to submit your first draft for review. 

## Review Submissions ##
When submitting content for review it must be submitted as both a _draft_ link on Medium and within a Google Doc. The Medium _draft_ will represent the tutorial with its final formatting, while the Google Doc will be used to add suggestions, comments, and any other feedback during the review process. 

> For more details see the Medium Help Center guide ["Share a draft"](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/215564177-Share-a-draft)

After you’ve submitted your first draft, an Agora Evangelist team member will pair you with an editor to help you revise and polish your work.

Once the comments and suggestions are all resolved on the Google Doc, the author will make the corresponding updates to the Medium draft. After all updates are made and the article is ready for publication, the Agora team will work with you to submit your project for publication. 

## Publishing Process ##
Once the editting process is complete, the tutorial will first be published on the Agora Blog. Upon publication of the tutorial on the Agora Blog, the author will be provided with a URL to the tutorial that will be used as the canonical link within the Advanced settings of the Medium post.
 
> For more details see the Medium Help Center guide ["Set a canonical link"](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033930293-Set-a-canonical-link)

Once the canoncial link is set, the author may publish their tutorial to Medium.
